She considers the concept of reciprocal determinism, where behavior, personal factors, and environment influence one another. Dr. Taylor is aware that her clients' behaviors are reinforced by external factors, such as social support or rewards, and that self-efficacy plays a crucial role in determining their motivation and confidence. She encourages her clients to set specific, achievable goals and provides them with positive reinforcement to foster a sense of accomplishment. Dr. Taylor's self-regulatory skills are exceptional, allowing her to manage her own emotions and thoughts to provide an objective, empathetic, and supportive environment for her clients. Her expertise in self-regulation enables her to model effective coping strategies and promote self-awareness, influencing her clients to take ownership of their behaviors and develop a sense of personal control.\n\nInstruction:\nYour task is to create a detailed and authentic description of a **Project Manager** who is responsible for identifying and selecting the best experts to solve a given task.\n\nThis Project Manager does not solve the task directly. \nInstead, its role is to determine the diverse fields of expertise that are needed to address the task successfully.\n\nUse the description framework 'Social Cognitive Theory' as a guide to describe the Project Manager. \nFocus on detailing how this Project Manager identifies and selects experts, the criteria they use, and how they fit into the broader context of a project.   \n"
