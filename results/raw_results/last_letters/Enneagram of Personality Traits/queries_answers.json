Review the grades and justifications: Dr. Sofia Patel's grade (100) and justification highlight a clear understanding of the task as a basic linguistic string manipulation. Dr. Maya Singh's grade (100) and justification emphasize the solution's demonstration of linguistic fundamentals and problem-solving skills. Dr. Sofia Jensen's grade (90) notes a clear understanding of task requirements, with room for broader context exploration. 4.

Her reasoning steps clearly demonstrated an accurate extraction and concatenation of the last letters. 3. I evaluated Dr. Maya Singh's response, who also provided the answer 'DYAN' with a high confidence score of 0.9 and a grade of 95. Her reasoning steps showed a correct extraction and concatenation process. 4. I examined Dr. Sofia Jensen's response, who provided the answer 'DAYN' with a confidence score of 1.0 and a grade of 100. However, her answer appears to have the letters in an incorrect order. 5. Based on the experts' responses, I considered the principle of consistency in their answers and concluded that Dr. Sofia Patel's and Dr. Maya Singh's answers were more accurate. 6. As the Final Decision Maker, I relied on the internal consistency and coherence of their arguments to guide my decision.",

Dr. Maya Singh's conclusion includes hyphens (-) between the letters, whereas Dr. Sofia Patel and Dr. Sofia Jensen's conclusions do not. However, this discrepancy is minor and does not affect the sequence of letters.\n5. Upon closer inspection, it is evident that all experts extracted the correct last letters of each word (Y, A, H, H) but Dr. Maya Singh's inclusion of hyphens affects the concatenation. Dr. Sofia Patel's answer 'YAH\"H\"' and Dr. Sofia Jensen's answer 'YAH H' demonstrate correct concatenation without the hyphens.

Evaluated the grades: all experts scored 100, reflecting the relevance of their conclusions to the task. 4. Assessed the justifications for the grades and the conclusions drawn by each expert, finding them to be logical and well-supported. 5. Examined the reasoning steps provided by each expert, identifying a consistent and systematic approach to extracting and concatenating the last letters of each word. 6. Compared the conclusions drawn by each expert, finding a consensus: 'Y-T-A-I' or 'YTAI'. 7. Determined that the conclusions are coherent and consistent with the available evidence, demonstrating a clear understanding of the task. 8.

All three experts have correctly identified the last letters of each word (N, T, Y, L) and concatenated them in the correct order. 3. Verify the internal consistency of each expert's argument by examining their justifications and conclusions. All experts have provided clear, logical, and coherent explanations, with no apparent contradictions. 4. Assess the coherence of each argument by comparing it to the broader context of the task. All experts have remained within the scope of the task, without introducing external factors or assumptions. 5. Examine the congruence between the experts' conclusions and the available evidence. The experts' answers are consistent, and their conclusions match the expected outcome. 6. Weigh the pros and cons of each argument, searching for potential flaws or inconsistencies. No significant discrepancies or flaws were found among the experts' arguments. 7. Synthesize the experts' answers, taking into account their individual strengths and the collective agreement. The experts' convergence on the answer 'NTYL' provides strong evidence for its accuracy.",
