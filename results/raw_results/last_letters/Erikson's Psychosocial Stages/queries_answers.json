Dr. Sofia Patel is a linguistics expert, while Dr. Elliot Thompson and Dr. Ethan Thompson specialize in Natural Language Processing and Cryptography respectively.Step 2: I compared the confidence scores and grades given by the experts for their answers. Dr. Elliot Thompson and Dr. Ethan Thompson have a confidence score of 1.0 and a grade of 100, indicating high certainty and relevance of their conclusion to the task.Step 3: I analyzed the justification provided by each expert. Dr. Elliot Thompson and Dr. Ethan Thompson's justifications seem reasonable and accurate based on the instructions provided for the task.Step 4: Finally, I looked at the experts' conclusions and their final answers. Although Dr. Sofia Patel's answer is LEYY, I decided to rely on the answers from Dr. Elliot Thompson and Dr. Ethan Thompson because their fields of expertise seem more relevant to this type of task and they showed the highest confidence and perfect grades. Their answers do not include the last Y from Jhonny in the final string.",

Dr. Sofia Patel's answer was LEYY, while Dr. Elliot Thompson and Dr. Ethan Thompson's answers were LEY. Since Dr. Elliot Thompson and Dr. Ethan Thompson have expertise in Natural Language Processing and Cryptography respectively, and both have the highest confidence score (1.0) and a perfect grade, I will rely on their analysis, considering that the confidence score and grade are perfect and their justification for the grade and conclusion appear sound.",
